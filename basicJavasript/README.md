also let and cost.

there are variables like numbers,string,boolien,undefined etc.


 ### var

The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### let

The let declaration declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

### const

Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration). However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.
